AB  - Sign language recognition (SLR) contains the capability to convert sign language 
      gestures into spoken or written language. This technology is helpful for deaf 
      persons or hard of hearing by providing them with a way to interact with people 
      who do not know sign language. It is also be utilized for automatic captioning in 
      live events and videos. There are distinct methods of SLR comprising deep 
      learning (DL), computer vision (CV), and machine learning (ML). One general 
      approach utilises cameras for capturing the signer's hand and body movements and 
      processing the video data for recognizing the gestures. One of challenges with 
      SLR comprises the variability in sign language through various cultures and 
      individuals, the difficulty of certain signs, and require for realtime 
      processing. This study introduces an Automated Sign Language Detection and 
      Classification using Reptile Search Algorithm with Hybrid Deep Learning 
      (SLDC-RSAHDL). The presented SLDC-RSAHDL technique detects and classifies 
      different types of signs using DL and metaheuristic optimizers. In the 
      SLDC-RSAHDL technique, MobileNet feature extractor is utilized to produce feature 
      vectors, and its hyperparameters can be adjusted by manta ray foraging 
      optimization (MRFO) technique. For sign language classification, the SLDC-RSAHDL 
      technique applies HDL model, which incorporates the design of Convolutional 
      Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). At last, the RSA was 
      exploited for the optimal hyperparameter selection of the HDL model, which 
      resulted in an improved detection rate. The experimental result analysis of the 
      SLDC-RSAHDL technique on sign language dataset demonstrates the improved 
      performance of the SLDC-RSAHDL system over other existing DL techniques.
